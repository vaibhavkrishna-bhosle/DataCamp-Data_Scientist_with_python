'''New data has been merged into the banking DataFrame that contains details on how investments in the inv_amount column are allocated across four different funds A, B, C and D.

Furthermore, the age and birthdays of customers are now stored in the age and birth_date columns respectively.

You want to understand how customers of different age groups invest. However, you want to first make sure the data you're analyzing is correct. You will do so by cross field checking values of inv_amount and age against the amount invested in different funds and customers' birthdays. Both pandas and datetime have been imported as pd and dt respectively.'''
