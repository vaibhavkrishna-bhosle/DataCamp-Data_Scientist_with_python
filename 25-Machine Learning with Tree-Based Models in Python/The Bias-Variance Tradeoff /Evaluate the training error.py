'''You'll now evaluate the training set RMSE achieved by the regression tree dt that you instantiated in a previous exercise.

In addition to dt, X_train and y_train are available in your workspace.

# Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics as MSE
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE

# Fit dt to the training set
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels of the training set
y_pred_train = dt.predict(X_train)

# Evaluate the training set RMSE of dt
RMSE_train = (MSE(y_train, y_pred_train))**(0.5)

# Print RMSE_train
print('Train RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(RMSE_train))
